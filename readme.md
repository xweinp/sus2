# General info

Most of my work is based on the deep reinforcement learning lecture from Stanford University: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP2XqpgTJyo
I also took some inspiration form tutorial in PyTorch docs and some other quick quides.

I use the replay memory (TODO: for what exactly?) and epsilon greedy actions for better exploration.
